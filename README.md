# Welcome to Road Rush!

Road Rush is an adrenaline-pumping game where you take on the challenge of driving a car on a 5-lane road while avoiding obstacles and collecting coins to score points. Every second you survive adds one point to your score, and collecting coins adds ten points each. But be careful! Colliding with obstacles will cost you one life, and you only have three lives in a game.

# Game Modes

Road Rush offers three different modes to match your play style. In Fast mode, you'll have to be quick on your feet as you navigate through traffic. In Slow mode, you can take your time and carefully avoid obstacles. For a more interactive experience, try the Sensors mode, which lets you control your car's movements using your phone's sensors.

# Leaderboard
 
Once you've completed a game, you can check out the Leadrboard to see the high scores you achieved on your device. The Leadrboard displays the top ten scores and their corresponding locations on a Google Map, adding an exciting new dimension to the game.
